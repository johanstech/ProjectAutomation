# ProjectAutomation

### Install

Navigate to the folder where you want to install, and run the following commands:

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/johanstech/ProjectAutomation.git"
cd ProjectAutomation
source $PWD/.automation.sh
auto-env
```

Note: The auto-env function is set up for Zsh. If you're using a different shell you'll have to modify the configuration file for that shell.

Open the autogenerated .env file and edit the values for GIT_USERNAME, GIT_ACCESS_TOKEN, and PROJECTS_BASEDIR.

```bash
GIT_USERNAME="Username"
GIT_ACCESS_TOKEN="PersonalAccessToken"
PROJECTS_BASEDIR="/Your/Projects/Directory"
```

Open .automation.sh and edit the path to your .env file.

```bash
source ~/<your/path/to/this/project>/.env
```

### Usage

Run the script from anywhere with the **create** command:

```bash
create <name of new project>
```
